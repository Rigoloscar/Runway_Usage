# Wind_Rose_Runway_Usage
Python program to compute the usage of a runway acording to its orientation using stadistical meteorological data on regard of crosswind and the wind rose approach. 
It can also compute by its own the best orientation possible. The txt file should provide de data for wids of 4-15 kt, 15-20 kts, 20-25 kts and 25-35 kts for 16 different
angles. The program also plots and represents the scheme visually.

Aimed at aeronautical engineering students.
