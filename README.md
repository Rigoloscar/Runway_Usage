# Wind_Rose_Runway_Usage
Python program to compute the usage of a runway acording to its orientation using stadistical meteorological data on regard of crosswind and the wind rose approach (ICAO Annex 14) and represents the scheme visually.
It can also compute by its own the best orientation possible. The txt file provides the stadistical wind data. The aim of the code is to help aerospace engineering students with runway orientation calculations.
